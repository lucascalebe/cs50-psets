                        <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
                        <p>I really love music, that's why i made a single page for it.</p>
                        <p>Everything started when i was 9 years old, my father used to play some guitar and listen rock'n roll, there was an acoustic guitar in your wardrobe,
                            but he didn't care for it,when he was working i took the guitar and tried to play some music.One day he came home from work early and saw me playing, he was so happy that
                             he let me play that guitar always i wanted.</p>
                           <p>As time passed, i kept studying every single day, and when i was 14, i was approved in Music School of Brasilia and started to study really hard. I used to like rock'n roll
                            because of my dad's influence, but when i joined in the Music School i found other genres like jazz,bossa nova, r&b, and i fell in love for these genres. After sometime
                             i got the first place in the contest to join in Professional guitarrist course in Music School of Brasilia. And since then i keep studying, but now i want to spend my time
                              improving my programming skills.</p>
